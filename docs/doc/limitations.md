<h1>11. Known issues and limitations</h1>

This is the current list of issues and limitations regarding the Programmable XBee SDK:

# 11.1. XBee Firmware Library

* The **Virtual EEPROM** is not currently supported by the **128KB module** variants.
* Special considerations must be taken into account, regarding some special pins on the XBee ZB (S2B/S2C):
	* The **RESET** pin, when used as standard GPIO, has to be configured as input (due to a limitation of the 9S08QE).
	* The **BKGD** pin, when used as standard GPIO, has to be configured as output (due to a limitation of the 9S08QE).

# 11.2. XBee Extensions for CodeWarrior

* Depending on your graphic card and drivers, you may see that the module image of the Smart Editor's Layout view is not correctly drawn after some resizes. Resizing the dialog again may fix this problem.
