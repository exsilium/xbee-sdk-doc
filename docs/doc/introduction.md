<h1>1. Introduction</h1>

The **Programmable XBee <script type="text/javascript">acronym("SDK")</script>** is a set of libraries, plug-ins, 
samples and tools offered by Digi which have been designed to facilitate the development of applications 
for programmable XBee modules.

**Programmable XBee <script type="text/javascript">acronym("SDK")</script>** provides the following resources:

*   **XBee extensions for CodeWarrior <script type="text/javascript">acronym("IDE")</script>**:    A set of plug-ins that extends the functionality of CodeWarrior development    <script type="text/javascript">acronym("IDE")</script>. These plug-ins add specific functionality    for Digi's programmable XBee devices. They provide better integration of the XBee modules    within CodeWarrior, simplifying the development of applications for these modules.
*   **XBee firmware library**: A specific and extensive API is also provided to    facilitate the development of applications for the programmable XBee modules. The library includes    several functionality components that can be configured and added to the project graphically, thus    simplifying the application development process.
*   **Package Manager**: The Package Manager is a plug-in that allows users to manage    the different software, documentation, updates and patch packages that keep the XBee extensions and    the rest of the components updated.

Following links explain what the CodeWarrior <script type="text/javascript">acronym("IDE")</script> 
and XBee extensions are, and their purpose.

# 1.1. CodeWarrior Development Studio IDE 

CodeWarrior Development Studio is a complete Integrated Development 
Environment (<script type="text/javascript">acronym("IDE")</script><acronym title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</acronym>) that provides a highly 
visual and automated framework to accelerate the development of the most complex embedded 
applications.

The single development environment of the CodeWarrior Development 
Studio is consistent across all supported workstations and personal computers within an 
organization. Its features and usage remains identical across the supported platforms. 
There is no need to worry about host-to-host incompatibilities. Learn once, use everywhere.

The CodeWarrior Development Studio contains all the tools needed to 
complete a major embedded development project: Text Editors, Compilers, Debuggers, etc.

# 1.2. XBee extensions

The XBee extensions is a set of plug-ins which extends the functionality 
of CodeWarrior development <script type="text/javascript">acronym("IDE")</script><acronym title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</acronym>. They add 
specific functionality for **Digi's programmable XBee** devices and provide better 
integration of the XBee modules within the CodeWarrior 
<script type="text/javascript">acronym("IDE")</script><acronym title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</acronym>.

The addition of these extensions in CodeWarrior simplifies the development 
of applications for these modules.

The XBee Extensions offer a wide variety of state-of-the-art development 
tool features that make development of programmable XBee applications easier and faster than 
ever before. These tools include intelligent editor configuration capabilities that initialize 
components of projects with simple configurations.

# 1.2.1. Benefits

<span class="maintext">A very reliable development environment is created by combining the
**XBee extensions**, the **XBee firmware library**, **documentation**, **samples** 
and third party **tools**; all under the same **product** and connecting them to the 
**CodeWarrior <script type="text/javascript">acronym("IDE")</script><acronym title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</acronym>**. Developing any 
programmable XBee application project within this environment has many benefits:</span>

*   **Simplifies software development** resulting in an accelerated and more efficient	design process.
*   Feature-rich and future-proof; common look-and-feel **minimizes effort required to	learn new tools.**
*   Easy and direct access to information **saves time and effort**.
*   Optimal and **most efficient** “out-of-the-box” development experience.
