<h1>7. Exporting and importing XBee projects</h1>

There are some situations where you may want to share your project with another person, work with your project on a different PC, etc. In order to do so, you will need to export your project. You will then be able to import your project onto any machine running CodeWarrior 10.2 with the XBee Extensions.

The XBee Extensions include 2 specific wizards to export and import XBee projects making this processes really easy.

# 7.1. Exporting a project

To export an XBee project follow these steps:

- Select the project you want to export from the Project Explorer view. Please note that the project must be open.

Click **Next** to continue.

- In the second and last page of the wizard you have to configure some metadata regarding the project such as title, project version (major.minor.revision) and a description.	This page also displays the settings of the project that will be exported (library version, module type, memory, etc.)
Click the **Browse** button and choose the path and file name where the project will be exported.

> ![Warning](images/icon_warning.jpg) **The zip file of the XBee project being imported must be generated with the	XBee project export wizard. If you try to select a zip file of a project that was generated using any other export wizard, you will receive an error and will not be able to import the XBee project.**
- The XBee project import wizard page will be filled with the information regarding the project being imported (title,	description, module type, etc.).

> ![Tip](images/icon_tip.jpg) *Before importing the project, you can change the Project ID, which is the name that the project will	have within your workspace, and the XBee Firmware Library version to use one of the libraries you have installed. However, it is recommended to use the default settings unless there is any kind of incompatibility or problem.
- Click **Finish** to import the project into your workspace
- Your project should be displayed in the Project Explorer view, as shown:

You should now be able to build and debug the imported project.
