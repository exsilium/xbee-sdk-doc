	@brief
	Application needs to provide this function as a method of
	receiving firmware updates over-the-air with Xmodem protocol.

	See xbee/ota_client.h for details on sending updates.

	Your application can support password-protected updates by checking the
	payload of the request.  If the payload is a valid request to initiate
	an update, this function should enter an "XMODEM receive" mode and
	start sending 'C' to the sender of the request, indicating that it
	should start sending 64-byte XMODEM packets with the new firmware.

	On Digi's Programmable XBee platform, this function would exit to the
	bootloader so it can receive the new application firmware.

									to use the payload for some sort of password
									verification
	@param[in,out]	context	user context (from cluster table)
