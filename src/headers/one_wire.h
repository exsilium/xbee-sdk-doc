 *
 *	@section api_1_wire_driver_macros 1-Wire ROM-Commands
 *	The 1-Wire protocol has 5 generic ROM-Commands that may be used with
 *	one_wire_write() and one_wire_write_byte() functions:
 *        - \b ONE_WIRE_READ_ROM 	: Read rom of device (only works when 
 *									  there is a unique device conected to the bus).
 *        - \b ONE_WIRE_MATCH_ROM	: Master will transfer the ROM of desired 
 *									  device, devices with different ROM will
 *									  stay idle.
 *        - \b ONE_WIRE_SEARCH_ROM	: Starts a ROM search over the 1-Wire bus.
 *        - \b ONE_WIRE_SKIP_ROM	: All devices will listen to command
 *									  regardless their ROM, use with care.
 *        - \b ONE_WIRE_AlARM_SEARCH: Similar to search ROM algorithm but only
 *									  devices with a triggered alarm will answer.
