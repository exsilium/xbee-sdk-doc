 *	The DS1904 has 2 specific commands that are defined as the following macros:
 *        - \b DS1904_READ_CLOCK 		: Allows master to read the current time
 *										  value and configuration resgister.
 *        - \b DS1904_WRITE_CLOCK		: Allows master to write time and
 *										  configuration resgiers.
 *  Also there are defined the two combinations of configuration register to
 *  enable or disable internal oscillator:
 *        - \b DS1904_OSC_ENABLE		: Enables RTC oscillator.
 *        - \b DS1904_OSC_DISABLE		: Disables.
