 *	The ocompare_ch_config function needs a parameter to state the active edge.
 *	The three different options are defined in the following macros:
 * 		- Input Capture active-edge macros:
 * 			- \b OCOMPARE_TOGGLE: to toggle output at output-compare interrupt.
 * 			- \b OCOMPARE_CLEAR	: to clear output at output-compare interrupt
 * 			- \b OCOMPARE_SET	: to set output at output-compare interrupt
